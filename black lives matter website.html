    <p>Think about this, go back to July 24, 2018 when Beauty Blender came out with their very own foundation. People realized that the color variation went from white to white to white to white to white to 3 darker shades. Makeup and Beuaty is one key factor racial injustice. Beuaty standards were and are still always "fair skin". Such beauty standards have led to more than 500,000 people using creams such as "Fair and Lovely" to lighten you skin. It's not only about the fact that you beleive having darker skin tones isn't goood, fairness creams are also not good for your skin. Daily use of such creams lead to systic acne, peeling of the uppper layer of skin, and most creams contain steroids that damage not only your skin but are health hazards as well. Having darker skin tones should be considered a blessing rather than a "curse". In movies, most actors/actresses taken upon are always fair, it set out unrealistic beauty standards for the younger generation. It puts down people with darker skin tones and makes it seem as though those with lighter skin tones have more "power", which on fact is wrong. It's a wrong teaching. It's a teaching that everyone thought ended in 1963 when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his famous "I have a dream..." speech. Yet, we are seeing ourselves back at square one again. Be someone in this movement. Be a leader not a listener.</p>

    <h2> WHY DO WE CARE?</h2>
    <img class= "wraptext" src= "blackberry.html">
    <p>We care because it's time to change. We need to do the best of our abilities to bring out racial justice, where peoplearent ashamed of the color of their skin. Where nobody is judged by the color of their skin. And, we want you to be a part of this change.</p>
