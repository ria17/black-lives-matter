        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <p>My name is Ria Rahesh, I am currently going into 9th grade. I've been a dancer all of my life. I've also played the piano for a long time. Most of the activites that i've done require going on stage, and going on stage mostly requires makeup. I was always very neglectant to what went on my face (to be honest what 7 year old notices that their foundation is not their shade?). It was onl yunitll recently that I noticed I could never fond my foundation shade, not could I find my conceler shade. I also noticed a rapid rate in fairness creams being put on shelfs and fairness cream ads being put out. It never made sense to me why you skin color was such a big deal? Thats why I decided to bring awarness to this. Amid this COVID-19 pandemic and B.L.M getting the spotlight it deserves, I felt that one way I can do my part in helping is to bring out black owned beuaty products. One of the biggest ways to support in my opinion is giving them business! Thank you for stopping by!
